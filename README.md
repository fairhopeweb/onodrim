# Onodrim

An experimentation in Crystal (http://crystal-lang.org) inspired by the
screenshot at the top of this article about Dwarf Fortress (http://www.seattleweekly.com/arts/enormous-dwarf-2610456/).

## Caveats

1. I know nothing about Crystal.
2. I know nothing about terrain generation.
3. I know nothing about Dwarf Fortress.

## Execution

Run this in the terminal:

    crystal onodrim.cr

It'll draw a grid of shapes and colours. It's a world! (use your
imagination).
