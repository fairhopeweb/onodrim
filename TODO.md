* Get rid of the place/drop distinction. If it's a single instance, put
  it at the location. If it's a collection, put it all from the
  collection

* When 'drop'ping, use the co-ordinates as the centre, not the top-left

* Figure out how to pass classes as parameters, instead of passing
  instances and then using their class to instantiate

* Add layering to the grid to keep track of what's been stacked on each
  space

* Track the objects that are added to the matric (right now they become
  indistinct once added)

* Stop building this
